# Android Utils 🛠️
This is a collection of useful and flexible utilities for Kotlin and Android development, designed to simplify common tasks and improve code quality. Each utility is an independent module that can be added to your project separately.

### 📚 Modules in this Repository
Below is a list of available modules, their brief descriptions, and links to detailed documentation.

## 🌳 TreeLogger
A flexible, hierarchical, and platform-independent logging system. TreeLogger allows you to fully control the log flow, create hierarchies to enable/disable logging for entire modules, transform messages on the fly, and easily plug in any output mechanism (console, Logcat, files, JSON for a server).

➡️ Detailed Documentation and Usage Examples for TreeLogger  [README.md](treelogger-core/README.md).

### 📄 Str / StrRaw 
A utility for more convenient and type-safe work with string resources in Android and Kotlin. It allows you to abstract away from Context and simplifies working with dynamic strings and formatting.
